<h1>Mips Restful Service Project</h1>
<p>I implemented RESTful service C++ application that converts an 8 hexdecimal value into MIPS instruction. I used 
The crow library to implement REST service. Consume the service with the following https://www.mips-converter.com/MIPS/{query} where {query} is replaced with an 8 digit hexadecimal eg: 0x00000000
or 32 bit instruction e.g: 00000000000000000000000000000000. A react-app with the domain https://www.mips-converter.com/ consumes the servcie and displays the result to the client.  </p>
